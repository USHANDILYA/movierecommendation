***Types of Recommendation System***
1. **Content-Based Recommendation Systems**: Recommend items based on the attributes of the items themselves, such as genre or keywords.

3. **Hybrid Recommendation Systems**: Combine content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to leverage the strengths of both methods for more accurate and diverse recommendations.
